# Taquin-N Puzzle Solver Documentation

## Introduction

This is a Python implementation of an N-puzzle solver (commonly known as the
sliding puzzle) using multiple search algorithms. The project demonstrates
different approaches to solving the puzzle while providing detailed
visualization and debugging capabilities.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into several sections:

1. [Main Project Overview](./main.md)
   - Project structure
   - Package organization
   - Root level files
   - Integration examples
   - Development guidelines

2. [Solvers Documentation](./solvers.md)
   - A* Search implementation
   - Breadth-First Search implementation
   - Depth-First Search implementation
   - Common solver features
   - Performance comparison

3. [Common Utilities Documentation](./common.md)
   - Board representation
   - Direction management
   - Utility functions
   - Configuration settings
   - Debug output formatting

## Key Features

- Multiple solving algorithms:
  - A* Search with Manhattan distance heuristic
  - Breadth-First Search with level tracking
  - Depth-First Search with depth limiting
- Detailed visualization of solving process
